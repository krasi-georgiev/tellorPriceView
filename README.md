Steps to deploy on local

1. Make sure you installed Metamask
2. Due to cors issue, you should disable the cors feature of the browser.
On OSX, you can follow this command in terminal.
`open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security`
3. try `npm install`
4. run `npm start`
5. Finally, you can check the result on http://localhost:3000
